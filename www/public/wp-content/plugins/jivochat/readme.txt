== Description ==

= Business Communicator for E-Commerce =

Unlike other live chat apps on the Wordpress Market, Jivo is [omnichannel](https://www.jivochat.com/blog/ecommerce/go-omnichannel-right-now.html). 

**Well, what does that mean?**
It means live chats on your website, chat support to clients on Facebook, messages to your company’s email address, and calls to a phone number in any country – all go to one convenient JivoChat live chat plugin.

* Everything is in one place: your messages and chat history can be found in one inbox so there’s no need to sign up for multiple communication tools
* Too easy: your team can react quickly to all inquiries -- you don’t have to switch between apps to reply on different channels
* Sales booster: you can double your sales by increasing website conversion rates and building better customer service experiences

== Social Proof == 

Every month: Jivo empowers **270k websites** around the world to engage in over **12 million** live chats.

= How does it work? 4 Platform Connection: =

* **Live Chat:** Talk with new and current visitors to your site with a proactive in-app chat.

* **Business Phone:** Get a phone number in 50+ countries or activate any existing number to make outgoing calls with Jivo Business Phone. Use professional features such as call recordings, transfers, routing and more. A unique Instant Callbacks feature encourages your potential customers to call you so that you can close more deals.
* **Email:** Redirect emails from your company’s address (like info@yourcompany.com) to the JivoChat Inbox – your team will reply faster and no message will ever be missed.
